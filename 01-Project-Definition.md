# Project Definition

## Problem

A major travel company is experiencing troubles with providing customers with
suitable relationship managers, that can help provide suitable holiday packages
toward the customer.

## Objective

Our objective is to help improve the operation of the travel companyâ€™s in-house
call management centre (CMC). To achieve this, we will be designing and
implementing a system that can help adjust the call flow rate and match
customers to suitable relationship managers that can provide suitable holiday
packages for them.

## Stakeholder Identification

- Relationship Managers
- Customers
- Business Executives
- System Developer

## Compiled Assumptions

Based on the project description, the following assumptions have been made to assist in analysing and providing a potential solution to the problem. The assumptions made were catered towards the needs of the Relationship Managers, Outbound Customers and Inbound Customers as they are heavily involved stakeholders in the project.

For the Relationship Managers, the assumptions made were to clarify the impact the new system would have on the current training and skills of the Relationship Managers. The following are the assumptions that have been made for the Relationship Managers:

- Current system is inefficient;
- Clientele is inaccurately assigned;
- Relationship Mangers are unsure about the change or if it will be beneficial;
- Concerns about sales and profiles needing to be re-evaluated.

For the Inbound Customers, the assumptions made were to define the potential reasons of becoming a customer for this company and to assist in the creation and improvement of the profiling tool that will be implemented. The following are the assumptions that have been made for the Inbound Customers:

- Customers calling in will want help with planning their holiday;
- Customers want someone with knowledge with where they want to go for their holiday.

For the Outbound Customers, the assumptions made were to assist in filtering potential customers for the Relationship Managers to contact in hopes of making a sale. The following are the assumptions made for Outbound Customers:

- Outbound Clients may not know about the company (Cold Leads);
- First calls would be to profile, then transfer to someone with specialised knowledge.
