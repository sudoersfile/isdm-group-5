# POV Statements

# User’s Perspective 

As a customer, I am looking to book a holiday, but I don't really know what I'm looking for when booking a holiday, and worried that I won't get the correct information I'm looking for when booking my holiday. 

# User Researcher’s Perspective 

Customers who are looking to book a holiday need someone who can assist and provide them with the correct information about the destination the customer wishes to travel to, as the customer may not have the knowledge or skills to do so by themselves.  

# Who, What, When Where Perspective 

Our customers struggle with booking the right holiday destination, as they may have little to no knowledge on their destination or booking holidays. Our solution is to match our customers to appropriate relationship managers that can provide the knowledge to our customers through an easy-to-use call routing system.
