## Assumptions

Based on the project description, the following assumptions have been made to
assist in analysing and providing a potential solution to the problem. The
assumptions made were catered towards the needs of the Relationship Managers,
Outbound Customers and Inbound Customers as they are the most involved
stakeholders in the project.

For the Relationship Managers, the assumptions made were to clarify the impact
the new system would have on the current training and skills of the Relationship
Managers. The following are the assumptions that have been made for the
Relationship Managers;

Current system is inefficient.

Clientele is inaccurately assigned.

Relationship Mangers are unsure about the change or if it will be beneficial

Concerns about sales and profiles needing to be re-evaluated

For the Inbound Customers, the assumptions made were to define the potential
reasons for becoming a customer to this company and to assist in the creation
and improvement of the profiling tool that will be implemented. The following
are the assumptions that have been made for the Inbound Customers;

Customers calling in will want help with planning their holiday

For the Outbound Customers, the assumptions made were to assist in filtering
potential customers for the Relationship Managers to contact in hopes of making
a sale. The following are the assumptions made for Outbound Customers;

Outbound Clients may not know about the company (Cold Leads)

First calls would be to profile, then transfer to someone with specialized
knowledge

The supporting Profile tool already in existence is out of scope of the project.
Staff and Customer Calls are actor behaviour not modelled since it is outside the scope of the system.
