# Competitive Advantages and Possible Effects If Project Fails

The new CMC system aims to improve the current call flow rate through the routing and prioritising of both incoming and outgoing calls. To do this, the system will adopt an accurate and efficient profiling tool that will match customers to suitable relationship managers. In comparison to the old system, it lacked such a profiling tool, and thus didn’t provide accurate matches between customers and relationship managers.

With a profiling tool being used, the customer service aspect of the relationship manager role is likely to also improve. With less time spent on trying to determine the customer’s needs or desires, the relationship managers can spend more time answering questions of concern or address any finer details of the holiday packages being sold. This will increase sales and likely decrease potential conflicts.

This will also allow the company to compile a more efficient and organized client list. Which will enable the company to use the data in an aim to understand the market and cater their packages towards trending locations or common travel periods. With this data, the company can assess their clientele and ensure their employees are trained accordingly.

Through incorporation of an interactive voice system that will allow customers to choose their reason for calling, the system will be able to reroute the incoming call to an appropriate relationship manager. This will assist in cost reduction as it saves on workforce and time.

This new system will also improve the relationship that customers have with the relationship managers. This means that the rapport building skills of the employees will likely increase, which will improve customer interactions and potential sales. With a higher customer satisfaction rate and customer service, it will also enhance the company’s image. An enhanced company image will in turn increase potential customers and potential sales. This image will also increase marketing value through word of mouth which will possibly reduce costs spent on advertising.

However, there is still potential for project failure. In this instance, project failure would result in an increase of unsatisfied customers, lowered morale amongst relationship managers and a negative impact on the company’s image. Mismatched customers and relationship managers can result in a loss of sales and a negative review from the customers. With an increase of mismatches or sales loss, it can also lower morale and efficiency of relationship managers. This will eventually affect the company’s sales and customer service image.
