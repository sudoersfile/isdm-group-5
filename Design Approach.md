In our design thinking approach, we started developing two empathy maps, one for inbound calls customers and one for outbound calls customers.  

All three of the empathy maps (shown below) are provided with a pain and gain section so we can have a clear view of the situation, and the outbound call empathy maps have a small section as well with assumption. This empathy phase helped us to gather important insights that will help us to solve the problem because we can easily define it. We created a section for the problem definition based on the feedback gathered from the previous artifacts, so we could define the objective. 

Empathize has been the most powerful tool that we used to understand and define the problem, design thinking helped us with looping phases and gather the best information from it. Customer(s) will be in constant contact during development.
