# POV Statements

# User’s Perspective

I am a young working professional that is trying to assist customers with
planning a holiday in the most efficient way possible. I specialize in Asian
based holiday packages, so I struggle when I am inaccurately matched with a
customer. This makes me feel frustrated as I need to pass the customer on to a
different colleague and makes it harder to meet my call requirements for the
day.

# User Researcher’s Perspective

Busy working professionals requiring a more efficient and accurate profiling and
call routing system that allows customers to connect to Relationship Managers
with appropriate skills and product knowledge. The system should profile
customers and relationship managers and route calls according to the profiles.

# Who, What, When, Where Perspective

Our young, busy professionals struggle with inaccurate matches with customers
for their skill set and product knowledge. Our solution is to implement a new
and improved system that has a more accurate profiling tool and an efficient,
easy-to-use call routing tool.
