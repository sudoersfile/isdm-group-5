# GitHub and Scrum

Over the course of the past few weeks, our team has utilised the agile methodology of Scrum to document and implement the CMC system. We chose to adopt Scrum because of its ability to promote early feedback, collaboration, and cooperation due to its iterative nature. With it, every member was able to contribute to the project in a continuous manner, as well as be self-organised and flexible in what parts we work on. Ultimately, Scrum has allowed us the opportunity to work in a team while being flexible, adaptable, and most importantly, agile.

## Roles

Before working on the report and related documents, we had to identify the everyone’s roles in Scrum. We identified the following roles:

- Product owner: Travel Company CMC
- Scrum Master: Sereena Carol
- Development Team: Alberico Antico, Alexander Bell, Cong Van, Ta-Seen Islam

## Activities

Before starting on the project, we began sprint planning. We identified our tasks in the Product Backlog using a Kanban board (using GitHub’s Project tab). All tasks were categorised in one of three columns: To do, In progress, or Done. During the sprint, we moved these tasks around to their appropriate columns, reflecting their current progress as we worked on them.

As we progressed through the sprint, we held stand-up meetings in private team calls on Mondays. In these meetings, the Scrum Master asked for the team’s current progress, what went well in the past week, and what went wrong. After the meeting, we continued working on the tasks that were left to do.

We used GitHub’s issue functionality to iteratively develop on our documentation, such as our diagrams. For example, an opened issue was accompanied with a member’s current draft of their diagram, and all other members gave feedback on it. This continued until the diagram is satisfied, where the issue was then closed. Other members worked on their respective section on a Markdown file, submitting commits and merge requests as they progressed.
